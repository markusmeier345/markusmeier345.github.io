      <description>This Card Game is a hobby project inspired by Inscryption, powered by Unreal Engine. Status: Unfinished&#xA;Background ðŸ”—I was the kid on the playground that knew the Yu-Gi-Oh! rules. Card Games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, PokÃ©mon TCG and Magic the Gathering played a big role for me when I grew up.
