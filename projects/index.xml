      <description>Background ðŸ”—I was the kid on the playgrund that knew the Yu-Gi-Oh! rules. Card Games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, PokÃ©mon TCG and Magic the Gathering played a big role growing up for me. I always wanted to make one myself, so when I had Corona and didnt know what to do with myself I decided to just go for it.&#xA;Visuals ðŸ”—I liked the idea of using old sketches from me. I could save time this way, but I also really like the rough aesthetic of an unfinished sketch.</description>
